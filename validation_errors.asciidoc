book.xml:95: element xref: validity error : Syntax of value for attribute linkend of xref is not valid

<simpara>Now to implement the model in Processing.  First, we&#8217;ll characterize the overlapping area first by its width and height.  Second, we&#8217;ll define its X and Y position as the location of its upper-left corner as it falls within the stationary image.  <xref linkend="3d-quadrants"/> (hopefully!) illustrates this rather abstract concept.  It presents a matrix of possible scenarios for rx and ry, as well as a simple diagram that shows how the overlap (represented by diagonal lines) is defined in that scenario.</simpara>
